            <h2>Electronic Disclosure and Consent</h2>
        <dt>Effective Date: July 16, 2025</dt>        
        
        <p>In this agreement, the terms "Verifen Funding," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Verifen Funding LLC,
including its subsidiaries and affiliated entities. The terms "you" and "your" refer to the business entity
accessing or using Verifen Fundingâ€™s services, including through the creation of an account or application
for financial products.</p>      
    
     <p><strong>"Communications"</strong> refers to any disclosures, notices, agreements, statements, terms, policies (including
privacy policies), records, documents, and any other information that we are required to provide you or that
you are required to submit or acknowledge electronically through our platform.</p>   
     <h3>Consent to Electronic Communications</h3>
        <p>By accepting this agreement, you confirm that you are able and willing to receive all Communications from
Verifen Funding electronically, and you expressly <strong>consent to receive them in electronic form</strong> only. If you
do not provide this consent, you will be <strong>unable to open or maintain an account</strong> with Verifen Funding.</p>

        
        <p>Should you later decide to withdraw your consent, your account with us may be subject to termination, and
you may lose access to our services.</p>
        
        <h3>Methods of Electronic Delivery</h3>
        
        <p>Verifen Funding may deliver Communications to you via:</p>
       <ul>
            <li>Our website at <a href="www.verifen.com">www.verifen.com</a> (the "Website")</li>
            <li>Our mobile application (the "App")</li>
            <li>Text or SMS messages</li>
            <li>Email using your provided email address</li>
       </ul>
        
        <p>If Communications are not delivered through the channels above, we will notify you how and where you
may access the required information.</p>       
        
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some documents may still need to be delivered in paper format if legally required.</p>   

        <h3>Technology Requirements</h3>       
        <p>To access and retain electronic Communications, you must have:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Microsoft Edge (v42 or later)</li>

        <li>Printing directly from your device, or</li>
        <li>Requesting a mailed copy by emailing: customerservice@verifen.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note, the availability of paper copies is at our discretion and does not create an ongoing obligation
to provide physical documents.</p>

        <h3>Legal Effect of Electronic Communications</h3>
        <p>Communications provided electronically or on paper will be considered as "in writing" under all applicable
laws. Your consent confirms that electronic delivery satisfies any legal requirement for information to be
