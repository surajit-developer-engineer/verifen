        <h3>11. Telephone Communications and Consent to Contact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Call Monitoring and Recording.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that
telephone calls made to or from Verifen, including its agents
and affiliates, may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and
training purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy of Contact Details.</strong> You affirm that any contact information
you provide to Verifen, including your name, mailing address,
email address, and telephone numbers (business, residential, or mobile),
is accurate and belongs to you. You confirm you are the rightful
subscriber or owner of all phone numbers submitted. Providing a phone
number that is not yours is strictly prohibited. Should any of your contact
details change, including ownership of any telephone numbers, you agree
to notify us promptly before the change occurs by either replying STOP
to any text message you receive from us, calling (888) 788-6160, or
sending written notice via email to privacy@Verifen.com.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent to Automated Communications.</strong> By voluntarily providing your
phone number(s), you expressly consent to receive autodialed,
prerecorded, or artificial voice calls and text messages (including SMS,
MMS, or future messaging technologies) from Verifen and its
authorized representatives concerning promotions, your account,
transactions, or your relationship with us. This consent applies even if
your number is listed on any state or federal Do Not Call registry. You also
consent to be contacted via any email, mailing address, or phone number
you or your representative provide, or that we obtain through lawful
means such as caller ID or skip tracing. This consent continues even if
your account is closed or relationship with us ends, unless you opt out as
described below. Consent to receive automated promotional
communications is not required to purchase products or services.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out Procedures.</strong> You may opt out of receiving automated text
messages at any time by replying STOP to any text message received
from us. Reply HELP for assistance. Please note that messaging may
come from multiple shortcodes; replying STOP to one shortcode does not
unsubscribe you from all. To opt out of automated voice calls, you must
provide written notice to privacy@Verifen.com including your full name,
mailing address, account number, and the phone number(s) for which
you revoke consent. It may take up to 30 days to process your opt-out
request. Non-automated calls may still be made to you. Please be aware
that third parties who have your contact details may still contact you
despite your opt-out request; we are not responsible for those
communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Charges for Messages and Calls.</strong> Receiving automated calls or texts
from Verifen does not incur a fee from us. However, standard
message and data rates may apply per your phone carrier’s plan, which
you are responsible for. Please check your wireless plan for details.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Phone Use.</strong> You agree to promptly notify Verifen
if your telephone device is lost, stolen, or if you suspect unauthorized
use. Although we are not liable for losses from unauthorized use, you may
be responsible for any resulting damages.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold Verifen
harmless from any claims, liabilities, or expenses (including reasonable
attorney fees) arising from your providing inaccurate or unauthorized
telephone information or failure to update contact details, including
claims under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act or equivalent laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Release of Claims.</strong> You release Verifen from all claims,
damages, or liabilities related to telephone calls or text messages you
receive from us, including those alleging violations of federal or state
telemarketing, privacy, or consumer protection laws.</li>
        <li><strong>General Responsibilities.</strong> You are responsible for obtaining and
maintaining all equipment, devices, and services necessary to receive
calls and messages. Availability of text messaging may vary by carrier
and device compatibility. Your obligations under this section survive
termination of these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Message Service Terms.</strong> By opting in to Verifen’s text
message service (“SMS Service”), you accept these terms, including
binding arbitration and waiver of class actions as outlined in Section 10
(“Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration”). You authorize Verifen
Funding to send marketing and service messages to the phone number
you provide, using autodialing or manual methods. Opting in is not a
condition of purchase or service.</li>
        <li>You affirm you are authorized to use the phone number provided. After
opting in, you may receive welcome or administrative messages,
including requests to confirm your opt-in. You may cancel the service
anytime by texting STOP, after which you will receive a confirmation
message and no further texts will be sent unless you re-subscribe.</li>
        <li>For help, text HELP or contact support@Verifen.com or call (888)
788-6160. Carrier delays or failures in message delivery are not our
responsibility.</li>
