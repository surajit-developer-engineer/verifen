            <h2>Consent to Telephonic Communications</h2>
        <dt>Last updated: July 16, 2025</dt>

        
        <h3>1. Call Monitoring and Recording</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that telephone conversations to or from Verifen
Funding, including those involving its agents and affiliates, may be recorded and
monitored for quality assurance and training purposes.</p>

    <h3>2. Accuracy of Contact Information</h3>
     <p>You certify that any contact details you provide to Verifen—including but
not limited to your name, mailing address, email address, residential or business
phone numbers, and mobile phone numbers—are accurate and that you are the
authorized subscriber or owner of the phone numbers provided. Providing phone
numbers not owned by you is prohibited. If Verifen discovers any
inaccuracies or false information, your account may be suspended or terminated.
You agree to promptly notify us of any changes to your contact information by
replying STOP to any text message received from us, calling (888) 788-6160, or
emailing privacy@Verifen.com.</p>
     <h3>3. Consent to Receive Automated Calls and Texts</h3>
        <p>By voluntarily providing your telephone number(s), you consent to receive calls
and text messages from Verifen and its authorized representatives, which
may include prerecorded, artificial, or AI-generated voice messages, as well as
autodialed communications, for purposes related to promotions, your account,
applications, transactions, or your relationship with Verifen. These
communications may be sent to numbers listed on any Do Not Call registry. You
also consent to Verifen contacting you at any email or mailing address you
provide, or obtain lawfully through means such as skip tracing or caller ID. You
understand that consent to receive such automated communications is not a
condition of purchase. To inquire without consenting, contact us at (888)
788-6160 or privacy@Verifen.com. See the Opt-Out section below to stop
automated communications.</p>

        <h3>4. Opt-Out Instructions</h3>
        <p>Your consent is voluntary, and you may opt out of automated calls and texts at any
time. To stop text messages, reply STOP to any text from us; you may also reply
HELP for assistance. Please note that different shortcodes may require separate
STOP messages to unsubscribe fully. Alternatively, you may email
privacy@Verifen.com with the phone number(s) you wish to remove. To opt out of
automated voice calls, you must send a written request including your full name,
email, business name, and phone number(s) to privacy@Verifen.com. Please allow
up to 30 days to process opt-out requests. Opting out of automated messages
does not prevent us from contacting you via non-automated calls. Third parties
may have your contact details and may still contact you despite your opt-out;
Verifen is not responsible for those communications.</p>

        <h3>5. Charges for Communications</h3>
        <p>There is no charge from Verifen for automated calls or texts; however,
your phone carrier may charge fees, including message and data rates, which you
are responsible for. Check your plan details for applicable fees.</p>

        <h3>6. Unauthorized Use of Your Phone</h3>
        <p>You must promptly notify Verifen if your phone or device has been used
without authorization. While Verifen is not liable for unauthorized use, you
may be responsible for losses arising from such use.</p>

        <h3>7. Indemnification</h3>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Verifen against any claims,
including under federal or state telephone consumer protection laws, arising from
your provision of incorrect contact information or failure to update us about
changes to your contact details.</p>


        <h3>8. Release of Claims</h3>
        <p>By using our services, you release Verifen from any claims or legal actions
related to telephone calls or texts you receive, including those alleging violations
of laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act or similar statutes.</p>

        <h3>9. Your Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the devices and service needed to receive
calls and texts. Text messaging may be limited to certain carriers and compatible
devices. Your obligations here survive termination of your agreement with Verifen
Funding.</p>

        <h3>10. Text Message Terms</h3>
        <p>By opting into Verifen’s text messaging service, you authorize us to send
texts—including marketing content—to your cell phone number using automated or
manual technology. You confirm you are authorized to opt in on behalf of the
phone number provided. After opting in, you may receive welcome or
administrative messages. You can unsubscribe at any time by texting STOP, after
which you will receive confirmation of your opt-out. For help, text HELP or contact
support@Verifen.com or call (888) 788-6160. Message and data rates may apply.
You may receive up to 15 messages per month.</p>

        <h3>11. Privacy</h3>
        <p>For information about how we collect and protect your personal information,
please review our Privacy Policy at www.Verifen.com/privacy-policy.</p>
