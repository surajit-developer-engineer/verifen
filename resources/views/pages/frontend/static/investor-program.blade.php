            <h2>Invest with Confidence. Grow with Verifen.</h2>
        <dt>Fixed Monthly Payouts. No Market Volatility. No Lending Risk.</dt>        
        <h3>Welcome and Agreement Overview</h3>

        <p><strong>Why Invest with Verifen?</strong></p>
        <p>At Verifen, we‚Äôre reshaping how capital is deployed and how investors can participate in the 
                growth of America‚Äôs small businesses through structured receivables purchases backed by our 
                proven business funding model and reinforced with multi channel risk mitigation.</p>  
       
        <p>You help fuel the growth of America‚Äôs small businesses while receiving fixed monthly distributions 
                that far exceed returns from traditional investments like CDs, bonds, or savings accounts.
</p> 
        <p>Our model offers secure, fixed monthly payouts through a receivables participation strategy, 
                not tied to any specific loan or classified as a security.</p>
        <p>You‚Äôre not lending money. Instead, you‚Äôre purchasing a portion of Verifen‚Äôs projected future receivables, 
                enabling real businesses to access growth capital, while you receive predictable, contractual distributions 
                under our receivables purchase model.</p>

    <p><strong>How the Verifen Revenue Participation Model Works</strong></p>        
    <ol>
        <li>Choose Your Participation Level
You choose your capital participation tier (starting at $10,000). This capital purchases a share of Verifen‚Äôs 
receivables pool for the next 12-month cycle. You may add new positions at any time.
</li>
        <li>Capital Deployed to Verified Business Funding
Verifen funds qualified small businesses through structured revenue-based agreements and terms loans. 
In higher-risk scenarios, capital is sourced from third-party brokers, protecting Verifen's receivables pool.
</li>
        <li>Fixed Monthly Distributions
Investors receive contractual monthly distributions equivalent to 2% of their position based on a 1.24 factor 
rate purchase of projected receivables over 12 months. This is not interest. It is a fixed payout based on 
receivables performance forecasting.
</li>
        <li>Reserve & Diversification Protection
To safeguard your capital, Verifen allocates portions of its portfolio into real estate and crypto reserve accounts. 
These protect against business underperformance while maintaining payout reliability.

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Is this a loan or interest based investment?</strong></p>
        <p>No. Verifen does not offer lending investments. Your capital purchases a share of Verifen‚Äôs 
        projected receivables pool under a fixed factor rate structure. It is not classified as interest or a debt security.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: How is my principal protected?</strong></p>
        <p>Your principal is not tied to any specific loan and your position is supported by Verifen‚Äôs internal reserves, diversified assets, 
                and non-performance risk controls. Your capital is not tied to any single borrower.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What happens if Verifen doesn‚Äôt deploy my capital during the investment period?</strong></p>
        <p>You will still receive your guaranteed 2% monthly return. Your earnings are not dependent on whether 
                your capital is used or repaid, returns are fixed and backed by Verifen‚Äôs reserve structure.</p>

         <p><strong>Q: How do I access my monthly returns?</strong></p>
        <p>We deposit your 2% return directly into your bank account, and you can track it in your investor portal.</p> 

        <p><strong>Q: Can I reinvest or increase my investment?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes. You can renew your position at the end of each 12-month term or start additional 
                investment positions at any time during the year, based on your financial goals and available capital.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is there a minimum investment amount?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes. The minimum investment to participate is $10,000, with a maximum of $250,000 accepted for new investor accounts.</p>
